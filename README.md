# DOL-PONG
Pong for dolphins and people

PLEASE TAKE NOTE that

1. this is more of a work in progress for things in the future.
2. I had ai help me with some (a lot) of the code
3. please don't use this a dolphin's expense (i.e. forcing them to play it, or starving them if they don't. It should be the dolphin's choice, not your's)
4. Please contact me if you have any questions, if you want to use this with live dolphins, or if you have found any problems in the code.

PLEASE AND THANK YOU
